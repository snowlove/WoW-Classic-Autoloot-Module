# WoW-Classic-Autoloot-Module
Allows users to set mount color preferences via whipser using bangs !color red|blue|green|yellow and saves them to SavedVariables,
Auto clears them from the pool when they receive the mount.


Autoloots MasterLoot threshold items to self if they are the masterlooter to hold items for awarding later (DKP System, who stops to bid items right then?)


can be thrown into any existing addon easily
* will need to change SavedVariable name and add it to your .toc
* will need to change hardcoded "-Herod" to your realm name.
